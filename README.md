# Park for playing with ros2

This repository contains many meta-packages for playing around with the features of ros2.

## Current status 

Still under development. Packages that can be used are the pg_pub_sub and pg_cpp_pub_sub, and the pg_cpp_python_boost packages.
Edit as required and use. 

The names are self explanatory as to what they do.

## TODO:

Add more comments, how-to's, general documentation etc.
Fix cpp_python mixed package.
